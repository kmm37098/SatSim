- add my research from google drive to the repo

#### functions
- refactor area code  
- make area code actually work
- fix instability. Should max out a .5, but not reset immediately to 0 upon reaching that

#### math
- verify math and numbers  

#### tedious
- assess top-level variables marked by todo
- make all numbers have variables/constants where necessary (more readable) ---done except for area code 

#### long-term
- test on different screen sizes - positions should be a function of window size
- show missed area
- allow for changing of simulation values (swath size, etc.) 
- add path
