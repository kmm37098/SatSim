- improve README

#### functions
- refactor area code  
- make area code actually work

#### math
- verify math and numbers  

#### view
- shift actual simulation pieces up into view  
- dynamic components should be at the bottom of the loop

#### tedious
- assess top-level variables marked by todo
- make all numbers have variables/constants where necessary (more readable)
- adjust all areas necessary w/ view multiplier 

#### long-term
- test on different screen sizes 
- show missed area
- allow for changing of simulation values (swath size, etc.)
